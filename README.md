## About Me
I build intelligent systems that turn complex data into actionable insights. With a background bridging business strategy and technical implementation, I specialize in translating data science solutions into real-world business value.
Currently pursuing my MS in AI in Business at Arizona State University, I bring a unique perspective to technical problems—combining rigorous machine learning methodology with clear communication tailored to stakeholders, whether they're executives, engineers, or end-users.

# Featured Projects
## 🧬 Protein Structure Prediction System
Multi-Model ML Pipeline for Drug Discovery
Built an end-to-end computational triage system using three models selected for distinct prediction tasks:

BiLSTM Neural Network → Secondary structure prediction (71.98% Q3 accuracy)
Random Forest Classifier → Protein stability classification (60% accuracy, 0.611 AUC-ROC)
Isolation Forest → Anomaly detection flagging ~5% structural outliers

Impact: Reduces initial drug candidate screening from 6-18 months to minutes, with potential cost savings of $100K-$500K per structure.

## Technical Philosophy
I believe the best data solutions are audience-aware:

For Executives: High-level dashboards with clear KPIs and business impact metrics
For Engineers: Well-documented code, reproducible pipelines, and scalable architecture
For End-Users: Intuitive interfaces that surface insights without requiring technical expertise

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to work across the entire data lifecycle—from raw data ingestion to production deployment—while adapting my communication style to the audience at hand.
